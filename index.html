                            Fear can make people act in ways they normally would not. It can also make governments make rude decisions. After the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, fear was spread quickly across the United States. Many Americans worried that another attack could happen at any moment. Because of this fear, Japanese Americans were treated with suspicion. They were judged, but not for what they did, but by where their ancestors came from. More than 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry were forced to leave their homes and live in internment camps. According to the U.S. National Archives, about two-thirds of them were American citizens. They had done nothing wrong. Still, the government treated them as potential enemies. The internment of Japanese Americans shows how quickly fear can lead to injustice, even in a country that values freedom.

                            Discrimination against Japanese Americans did not start with World War II. For years before the war, Japanese immigrants faced unfair laws and social prejudice. They were often not allowed to own land or take certain jobs. Historian Roger Daniels, in Prisoners Without Trial, explains that these negative attitudes were strongest on the West Coast. After Pearl Harbor, these old prejudices became even stronger. Many people assumed Japanese Americans could not be trusted, even though there was no evidence. In fact, a 1941 report from the Office of Naval Intelligence concluded that Japanese Americans were loyal to the United States. The government ignored this report and instead acted on fear and public pressure.

                            On February 19, 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066. This order gave the military the power to remove people from areas considered dangerous. It did not name Japanese Americans directly, but in practice, it affected them almost exclusively. Families were given only a few days to prepare. They could take only what they could carry. Homes, businesses, and farms were often abandoned. Photographs taken by Dorothea Lange show Japanese American families waiting quietly with suitcases and identification tags. Their faces reveal fear, confusion, and sadness. These images capture how sudden and shocking the removal was.

                            After leaving their homes, families were sent to internment camps in remote parts of the country. War Relocation Authority records show that ten main camps existed. The camps were surrounded by barbed wire and guarded by armed soldiers. Families lived in small wooden barracks. There was little privacy. Winters were cold, and summers were extremely hot. Medical care was limited. Life was difficult. Even so, many people tried to build normal lives. They opened schools, published newspapers, and created community activities to support one another. They worked hard to make the camps feel like home.

                            <p>
                            The emotional impact of internment lasted long after the war ended. Being imprisoned by their own government caused fear, anger, and shame. Japanese Americans lost their freedom without a trial, which violated their constitutional rights. In Korematsu v. United States (1944), the Supreme Court supported the government’s policy. Today, this decision is widely criticized. Decades later, the government admitted that internment had been wrong. The report Personal Justice Denied (1982) concluded that internment was caused by racism, fear, and poor leadership—not by military necessity. This led to the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, which included a formal apology and compensation for surviving internees.

                            The internment of Japanese Americans is an important lesson in history. It shows how fear and prejudice can lead to unfair and harmful decisions. It reminds us that civil rights must always be protected, especially in times of crisis. Learning about this event helps people understand the human cost of injustice. It encourages society to value fairness, respect, and justice for everyone, no matter their background.
